# DB Miner Project (Quotes App)

## Project Definition

**Pragati App (Quotes App)** is a feature-rich mobile application developed using Flutter, incorporating concepts such as SQLite Database, Animation, API Calling, and Local JSON Bank. The app provides users with a diverse collection of inspirational quotes, empowering them with personalized features and a visually appealing interface.

## Project Description

"Quotes" aims to provide an immersive and personalized experience for users seeking inspiration and motivation. By incorporating SQLite Database, Animation, API Calling, Local JSON Bank, fetching and saving quotes, category-wise organization, light and dark themes, splash screen, detailed quote screens, random background images and font families, quote wallpaper creation, and setting device wallpapers, the app offers a comprehensive solution for users to discover and engage with uplifting quotes that resonate with them.

## Project Objectives

- **SQLite Database**: The app utilizes SQLite Database to efficiently store and manage the quotes. Quotes fetched from the Local JSON Bank or API are inserted into a table, enabling seamless access and retrieval of the quote data. The database allows for efficient categorization and management of the quotes.

- **API Calling**: The app leverages API calls to fetch additional quotes, expanding the collection beyond what is available in the Local JSON Bank. This ensures a diverse and ever-growing collection of inspirational quotes for users to explore.

- **Fetch Quotes**: "Quotes" fetches quotes from either the Local JSON Bank or the API and inserts them into the SQLite Database. This allows users to explore a wide range of inspirational quotes based on their preferences.

- **Save Category-Wise Quotes**: The app enables users to save quotes based on different categories, allowing for easy organization and retrieval of quotes that resonate with specific themes or topics. Users can create and manage their own personalized collections of quotes.

- **Save Specific Quote Details**: Users can save specific quote details as favorites, storing them in a separate table within the SQLite Database. The app provides a dedicated page where users can view and manage their favorite quotes, offering quick access to the quotes that inspire them the most.

- **Light & Dark Themes**: "Quotes" offers a visually appealing experience with customizable themes. Users can switch between light and dark themes based on their preferences, ensuring comfortable usage in different lighting conditions and personalizing their app experience.

- **Splash Screen**: The app features an eye-catching splash screen that captivates users from the moment they launch the app. The splash screen can showcase inspiring visuals or animations, setting a positive and motivational tone for the user experience.

- **Detail Screen for Each Quote**: Each quote has a dedicated detail screen that provides additional information and options for customization. Users can explore the quote's content, set a random background image, choose a random font family, copy and share the quote as a wallpaper, or even set it as their device wallpaper.
